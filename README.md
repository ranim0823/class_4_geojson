# Foodscape of New York City 2025

## Description

This project is an interactive web map showcasing New York City's foodscape based on a dataset collected from Google Places API on restaurants. You can filter restaurants by the types of food they serve. The types are grouped into those based on geography, and those based on specific products they offer. This web map serves at the first step in a larger research project that examines the spatial distribution of restaurants in relations with certain characteristics of New York City's neighborhoods. (e.g. %foreign-born, %female,%white, place of birth, ancestry, average gross rent, average gross income) 

Through this resesarch project, I want to understand: 

1) Is there any correlations between the spatial distribution of certain types of restaurants with certain groups of people? For example, are there more coffee shops in neighborhoods with higher income or higher rent? Or, are "ethnic" restaurants more likely to locate in neighborhoods with higher percentage of foreign-born population? 

2)
